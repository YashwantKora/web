        No
        Oh, yeah
        Oh, yeah
        Yeah

        You try with me so many times, yeah
        You're cryin' out behind the smiles
        And I can see right through the lies
        Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
        And what we had is dead inside, yeah
        You're actin' like it's still alive
        And you still wanna make it right, yeah
        I know

        But I've been the hardest to love
        You're tryna let me go, yeah
        And I can see it, I can see it
        I've been the hardest to love
        It's hard to let me go, yeah
        And I can feel it, I can feel it (oh, yeah)

        I don't feel it anymore (yeah)
        The house I bought is not a home (no)
        Together we are so alone
        Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (oh, babe)
        Don't regret the day we met (we met)
        Don't forget that time we spent (we spent)
        Forget that we're in different beds
        I know

        'Cause I've been the hardest to love
        You're tryna let me go, yeah
        And I can see it, I can see it
        I've been the hardest to love
        It's hard to let me go, yeah
        And I can feel it, I can feel it
        I can't, can't believe you want me
        After all the heartbreaks, after all I've done, oh-oh-oh (oh, oh, oh)
        No, I can't, can't believe you trust me (trust me)
        After all the rough days, you still call me up (me up), oh-oh-oh
        'Cause I've been the hardest to love
        
        You're tryna let me go (tryna let me go), yeah (oh)
        And I can see it, I can see it (I can see it)
        I've been the hardest to love (love, babe)
        You're tryna let me go, yeah
        And I can feel it, I can feel it
